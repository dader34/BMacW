"""Emit one ECU's ENTIRE INPA UI as a single JSON file -- the IR.

The end state this serves: the app stops hardcoding screens and interprets
these files instead. One .IPO in, one JSON out, layout 1:1 -- rows, columns,
captions, gauges, lamps, menus, F-key numbers -- with translations left as the
only hand-maintained layer (each .IPO's strings are frozen in whatever
language BMW compiled it with; the `language` tag tells the renderer whether
deGerman applies).

ELEMENTS -- one per display statement, in source order:
    text    static caption           (ftextout / text / textout literal)
    value   a result printed as text (a bound variable reaches ftextout)
    gauge   analogout               (min/max resolved; unitKey when the unit
                                     itself is read from an _EINH result)
    lamp    digitalout or a per-ECU helper shaped (KEY, row, col, on, off)

`nr` on menu items is the ITEM number from the bytecode -- INPA's real F-key.

CONTROL-FLOW FIELDS (decoded from the jump/binop layer; all additive)

    element.showIf   {"key": K, "op": "==|!=|<|>|<=|>=|truthy|falsy",
                      "v": ...}
        the element is drawn only when result K satisfies the condition --
        INPA's `if (job_state != "OKAY") ftextout(...)`. Both branches of
        an if are still emitted; the renderer picks instead of drawing both.

    job.argSlot      global slot number feeding the job's VARIABLE argument
        (present only with argFromMenu): the join point for the two item
        fields below.

    item.promptArg   {"slot": n, "template": ["LAR;", {"input": 0}, ";",
                      {"input": 1}]}
        this key asks (see item.prompt), splices the dialog answers into the
        template, stores it in global slot n, and the screen it opens sends
        that slot as the job argument. {"input": k} is the k-th answer of
        the item's dialog(s), in declaration order. A renderer that fills
        the template can SEND the job; without answers it must not.

    item.step        {"slot": n, "delta": +16}
        this key steps a counter/address held in global slot n by delta and
        re-runs whatever reads it (MS450's memory browser: Address+10h).

WRITES are represented, never hidden: a job matching the write shapes carries
"write": true and the interpreter refuses to auto-run it. INPA's screen is
reproduced; the action stays behind the same until-verified-on-a-car gate as
everywhere else in this repo.

KNOWN LIMITS, carried in the data rather than papered over:
    - variant screens (one menu entry, N gearbox screens) stay separate
      screens; the menu item lists every target
    - job argument loops (RDC calls STATUS_RAD_IO once per wheel) are not yet
      structural; the job appears once
    - the fault-memory formatter builds keys at runtime; its screen emits
      whatever is static and no more

TRANSLATION is a second pass, not a render-time concern. This emitter gathers
every caption an ECU displays into `strings`; tools/ipo_i18n.js resolves them
once -- data/inpa-i18n/<ECU>.json first, then the shared vocabulary in
app/renderer/core/translate.js -- and writes the result back as `i18n`, consuming
`strings`. The interpreter looks up that map instead of translating.

That per-ECU layer is the point: BMW's compounds are not shared vocabulary.
"Gesteuerte LuftFuehrung GLF" is MS450's own phrase for its air-guidance
actuator, and a word rule general enough to translate it turns other ECUs'
captions into "Gecontrolse".

    Two shapes fall out of one symbolic walk of each ITEM body:

    for address and count, then the item builds
        seg_adr_anz = "LAR;" + adresse;  inttostring(anzahl, t);
        seg_adr_anz = seg_adr_anz + ";" + t

    walk keeps, per slot, the stored string as PARTS: literal strings and
    {"input": k} = the k-th answer of this item's dialog. Only a global
    slot whose parts use an answer is kept -- that is the only kind another
    proc (the screen's job) can consume.

    SELF-STEPPED COUNTERS -- MS450 m_speicher F5 "+ 10h" runs
    `addr = addr + 16`: an UNGUARDED `slot = slot +/- N`. Guards expire at
    their jump target ("- 10h" checks for borrow FIRST, then steps after
    the guard closes), so guardedness is positional, not item-wide sticky;
    the carry/borrow corrections inside the guards stay out. The delta is
    per SLOT: a browser that splits the address over byte vars steps the
    middle byte by 1 for "+100h", and the IR says exactly that.

# ---- INPA's OTHER gauge dialect -------------------------------------------
#
# analogout declares a bar outright, and the walker above turns it into
# {"t": "gauge", min, max}. But INPA also draws bars from a screen that only
# PRINTS -- caption, "[unit]", the key, then four doubles -- which lifts as
# {"t": "value"} with no unit and no range. BMS46's "analog values 1" is the
# whole screen in that dialect: on the car INPA fills it with labelled bars,
# and the app drew a bare label/value list, because irIsCard sends a screen
# whose rows are all plain values to the identity renderer.
#
# tools/ipo_gauges.py already mines that dialect (505 KB, 268 ECUs, 3955
# readouts). This joins it back onto the IR, which is the ONE source the app
# reads for a screen -- the older ecu._layout.gaugeSpecs route died with the
# "IR is the only source" refactor and nothing has written _layout since.
#
# A ZERO-WIDTH RANGE IS A 0..1 SCALE. INPA declares some readouts with all
# four bounds identical -- lambda-integrator as (80,80,80,80), the mixture
# adaptations as (10,10) and (40,40) -- and still draws a normal bar with a
# 0..1 axis. Photographed on a real car: integrator 1.00 and multiplicative
# 1.00 sit FULL while additive 0.26 sits at about a quarter. Only 0..1
# predicts all three; on the 0..80 the bytes appear to say they would be
# slivers of 1-3%. They are normalised factors -- the SGBD calls the first
# "Lambdaregelfaktor" -- which is why one scale fits regardless of the unit
# printed beside them.
#
# These were held back at first for a good reason: the numbers look like
# maximums, and reading (80,80) as "0..80" would have drawn Short Term Fuel
# Trim, centred on zero and going negative, against a floor of 0. The car
# is what settles it, not the bytes.
#
# STILL NOT PROMOTED:
#   * descending (96). ipo_gauges flags min > max, the signature of a range
#     whose floor is really negative: the bytes say 45.0 for a -45 °C floor
#     and nothing distinguishes them. Guessing the sign would draw a bar that
#     is confidently wrong, which is worse than the number alone.
# It keeps its unit if one was mined: a unit is a fact even when the range
# is not usable.
