"""Mine INPA's gauge dialect — caption, unit and real min/max per readout.

Some mined layouts carry rows with no unit and no range: KLIMA_5B's Analog
input screen has 53 rows, 33 of them bare. Those render as a 0..100 bar with no
unit, which is a guess wearing the costume of a measurement.

INPA declares them properly, in a dialect the earlier miners did not read:

    'Outside temperature ( Via K-Bus )'   row/col
    '[degrees C]'                         row/col
    STAT_TAUSSEN_WERT
    <double 45.0> <double 40.0> <double 45.0> <double 40.0>

caption, then the unit in brackets, then the result key, then four IEEE-754
doubles (min, max repeated). The doubles are little-endian, as everywhere else
in this format.

SIGN: the bytes hold 45.0 for a gauge whose real floor is -45 °C. There is no
negate opcode here (unlike the MS45 step keys), and nothing in the surrounding
bytecode distinguishes -45..40 from 45..40. So this tool does NOT invent a
sign: it reports what the file says and flags `descending` when min > max, which
is the signature of a range whose floor is negative. A consumer that already
knows the real range (the SGBD, or a hand-built layout) should keep its own.

Read-only: decodes an .IPO, never talks to a car.

#   "[degrees C]"  the normal case
#   "degree KW]"   BMS46's ignition angle -- the opening bracket is simply
#                  absent from the file
#   "mg/As/Zyl"    BMS46's load -- no brackets at all
# All three sit in the same slot, print in the same place on INPA's screen,
# and are followed by the same four doubles. Requiring the brackets meant
# BMS46's load (0..7) and its cooling-water-leave temperature (40..120) were
# dropped even though the ranges are right there in the bytes.
#
# The unbracketed forms have to stay tight. A bracketed unit is
# self-evidencing and keeps the permissive old shape; without brackets there
# is nothing to distinguish a unit from any other short string INPA prints in
# that slot, and this file is full of them -- an actuator screen prints
# "Read error memory" / "Clear" / FS_LOESCHEN in exactly this shape, which a
# loose pattern mines as a gauge whose unit is "Clear".

# kg/h), a "%", a degree sign, or be one of the short symbols INPA uses.
